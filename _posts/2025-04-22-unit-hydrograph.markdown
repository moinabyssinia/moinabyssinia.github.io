## Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph
The dimensionless unit hydrograph is one of several watershed related parameters incorporated
into NRCS hydrologic modeling procedures. The unit hydrograph influences the shape of the
runoff hydrograph generated by the model, particularly the peak rate of discharge. It does not
affect the volume of runoff which is determined by curve number. Unit hydrographs vary by
watershed based on many factors including watershed size, slope and length; geomorphic and
geologic characteristics; amount of storage; and degree of urbanization. A standard unit
hydrograph has typically been used that represents an average condition for much of the country.
It has been felt to be sufficiently accurate for the hydrologic design of conservation practices.
Detailed studies, however, have been conducted in some watersheds or regions to develop more
representative dimensionless unit hydrographs. With the enhancement of NRCS modeling tools,
it is now easier to incorporate these unique unit hydrographs into more routine hydrologic
analyses.
